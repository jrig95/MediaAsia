STICKY HEADER took me 3 hours, mostly trying to figure out how to get the nav bar to sticky to the below element; wasn't able to finish in time.

CLIENT infinite scroll spent 2 hours researching this but was unsuccessful with REACT

CONTACT FORM SUBMIT BUTTON about 2.5-3 hours, was able to get it to update to success but didn't have time to finish the loading state.

I was generally able to spend 3-4 hours a day after work on the project.  I think I have A LOT to learn, this took me far longer than anticipated. I really want to learn more and grow as a front-end developer.
